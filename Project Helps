### Project Helps

## Getting Started with the template provided
On the README.md file within the template, the section "Git" says, "If you look to the far left, you'll see a button that has 3 small circles & 2 lines. If you've edited any files, you'll also see a blue dot with the count of edited files." I don't see this on my page though, so any help here would be great.
