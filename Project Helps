### Project Helps

## Getting Started with the template provided
On GitHub in your repository:
1. Click the green "Code" button
2. Click Codespaces and then "Create Codespace"

When it launches, you'll be an a VS Code editor window in your browser. See attached screenshot. From there,
1. Click the Gear Icon at the bottom left
2. Type in "live server" to search for the Live Server extension
3. Click install
4. Go back to the list of files (Files icon at the top left)
5. Right click on "index.html" and click "Open with live server"

You should now see a new tab in your browser with a visual representation of your index.html. Note that your current repo has just a <title> element which sets the browser tab title but does not display anything. You'll need to add more HTML after the <body> element.

To connect that index.html to your CSS and JavaScript, you will need to also add the following HTML:
<script src="scripts/primary.js"></script>
<link rel="stylesheet" href="style/primary.css" />
