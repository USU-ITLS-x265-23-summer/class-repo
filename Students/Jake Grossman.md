I am in the ITLS MS program. I work at USU making materials accessible and designing training materials.  I have experience with html but next to nothing beyond that.  I have used html for creating in Canvas as well as very very simple websites.  I used to be an educator and taught classroom teachers ways to use technology to enhance learning.  Now that I work at USU, I mainly instruct new student employees.

I want to grow my skills with this class and learn many more tools that I can use for projects.
