# Hi I'm Craig Butikofer :wave:
My GetHub username is: CraigButikofer
My UtahJS slack username is: Craig Butikofer
  I'm from Idaho Falls, Idaho
  I love to get outside, play sports, and travel
  I got my undergrad at BYU-Idaho in Business Management and I am working on my Masters in Instructional Design
I don't have a lot of experience with web development, the closest relatable experience I have is doing a little bit of VBA coding.
I have a little bit of experience as an instructor. I have done a little bit of substitute teaching and I taught a release time religion class in conjunction with a local high school. 
For my job I help design camps for teenagers all over the world. I help to train the individuals who put the camps on and I would love to be able to design a web-page for those individuals and make it accessable.
My favorite quote is: 
# You are you, and that is truer than true, there is no one in the World who is youer than you" - Dr. Seuss
Lastly, thank you for all the kind feedback. I did know it was unfinished, but I had started so that I could get a feel for the assignment. I had a short vacation planned and was not able to be at my computer for the second half of last week. I did as much as I was able to at the beginning of the week and I'm now playing catch up.
