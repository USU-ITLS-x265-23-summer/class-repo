**###About Me###**
One of my favorite quotes is "you only live one, but if you do it right, once is enough"- *Mae West*
Hence whey I am taking this class. I am a Master of Arts student in the ITLS program. I have been an eductor for the last 10 years but I am looking to tranistion out of teaching in the next year or two. 
This is my first buidling sites from code, but I am excited for the challenge! My hope is the learn how to build a site for my portfolio and then possibly get into Ux design.
