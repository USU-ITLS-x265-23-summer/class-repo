## Web Development Experience
My first web page was built in 1995 on a free server called GeoCities as a Freshmen University student. It was nothing more then a simple one page website built using HTML that contained a couple of paragraphs of text and a hideous repeating background. I have never been a developer, but I like to pretend. I currently manage the marketing technology for a large banking company in the western region. This includes the web design and development teams. I have a pretty good understanding of the concepts of web development and I can make due with some coding, but I would not call myself a developer. I manage teams of amazing developers, but it has been many years since I had to do the actual coding.

## Experience as an instructor
My original plan was to be a teacher. I come from parents who were teachers and I find that I lean toward this as well. As a manager, I spend a lot of time providing instructions and guidance to my teams. It may not be classroom instruction, but sometimes it does feel like herding cats. :)

## My goals for the class
I have spent the last 15 years leading web developers. As a DBA and as a .Net developer in my early career, I have learned how to work with developers and how to lead them. I have watch my teams deliver amazing products for my clients. I am a good leader, but I feel that I will be able to empathize with them more if I gained more experience in the specifics of what they are experiencing. I understand most of the concepts, but it is only from on the job experience and no formal instruction. I would like to close some of the gaps in my understanding.

## Favoriate Quote
> We have surmounted all the perils and endured all the agonies of the past. We shall provide against and thus prevail over the dangers and problems of the future, withhold no sacrifice, grudge no toil, seek no sordid gain, fear no foe. All will be well. We have, I believe, within us the life-strength and guiding light by which the tormented world around us may find the harbour of safety, after a storm-beaten voyage.<br>
