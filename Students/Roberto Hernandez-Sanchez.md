### About me:
* I am a Spanish teacher. 👨‍🏫
* I am originally from Mexico, but I have been living in the US since I was 8 years old. 🌎
* I currently live in Pennsylvania. 📍
* I don't have any experience with web development, so I am trying to be very patient with myself.
 
As I have previously mentioned I am a spanish language teacher. 
This is my 3rd year teaching Spanish and I have taught English as a foreign language in Mexico as well. 
I am very interesting in graphic design and I am always trying to include technology in my teaching to make more engaging lessons for my students.
