About me:
I am a Spanish teacher. 👨‍🏫
I am originally from Mexico, but I have been living in the US since I was 8 years old. 🌎
I currently live in Pennsylvania. 📍
I don't have any experience with web development, so I am trying to be very patient with myself.As I have previously mentioned I am a spanish language teacher. 
This is my 3rd year teaching Spanish and I have taught English as a foreign language in Mexico as well. 
I am very interesting in graphic design and I am always trying to include technology in my teaching to make more engaging lessons for my students.
My favorite quote is:
"The question isn't who is going to let me; it's who is going to stop me." -Ayn Rand
