# Week 04 - RECOVERY AND BREATHER WEEK

## Technical Tasks

So far we've covered a whole lot of material.  For some of you, it will be useful just to go back through what has already been covered, and start filling in some gaps.  This is your chance to do so.

However, we do still have some new tasks.

### HTML && CSS

1. [FreeCodeCamp - Learn HTML forms by building a registration form](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/2022/responsive-web-design/#learn-html-forms-by-building-a-registration-form)
   - NOTE: There will be aspects of this course that were covered in previous FreeCodeCamp exercises that were _not_ required for our course.  As needed, you'll need to do some research and ask for help when you run into these things!

### Games as a means of instruction

Play [CSS Diner](http://flukeout.github.io/) to completion.

Shall we play another game? - Yes, we shall play another game.  Select one or more of the following and play for at least 45 minutes.
(I have _not_ played all of these, but I've heard good things about the ones that I haven't played.)

## All technical topics

- Take time to review anything that's been particularly challenging.  Post questions to the discussion form. Ask for different examples, etc.  Likewise, help your classmates with the topics that they find challenging.


## Instructional Tasks

Post to the Discussion board what you liked, disliked, and what you would change about the games you played.

## Project Task

Based on the various online instructional approaches that you've experienced (in this course or elsewhere), select 4 of your current project ideas and explain how you might provide instruction using the instructional techniques that you have found useful and not useful.
