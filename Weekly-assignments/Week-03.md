# Week 03 - CHALLENGING WEEK

## Technical Tasks

You've now had a very basic introduction to some JavaScript and HTML concepts.

For some of you, Week 2 has left you in wonderland.  That's okay!  We're going to learn some more mind-twisting material this week.  Do your best with it.  Make sure you're asking questions in the Discussion section and adding notes to this collective repo.  There are also some games this week and a recovery week coming up, so that you can review all the material that just didn't make sense the first time through.
