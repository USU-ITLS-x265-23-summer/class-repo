# Week 08 - Callbacks & Promises

## Technical Tasks

This week the assignments are mostly self-directed readings about two core concepts: callbacks & promises.

Junior learners tend to miss the nuisances and importance of these concepts, meanwhile, they can actually be surprisingly difficult concepts for people who know other programming languages[1].  However, understanding these 2 concepts —even if it's only a tenuous understanding— is important before moving on to subsequent JavaScript topics.

As you read through these, you'll notice that most of these resources discuss how promises fix something called "callback hell".  This is true, but it is important to understand that callbacks are still a very common and important aspect of JavaScript.  So, you should also be paying attention for indicators of why you should use one or the other.

Also of note, you'll see `setTimeout` used frequently in these discussions.  This is a function that you will almost never use in actual code.  The reason you see it used so often for these topics (often times along with some type of randomness features) is solely to provide simulated delays in responses.

Some of these resources include integrated editors, while others don't.  For those that don't, you can use an online editor to work through the example code.  Each of these online editors has the ability to display the "console" output of the JavaScript, althought you may need to configure it to do so.

  - Most of the examples in this article are simply pseudo-code, so just read this one until the exercise at the end.  
  - There are also a few additional topics covered in this reading that you should skip, specifically "Network flooding", "Message routing", & "Generators".
  - While the previous readings didn't cover "The event loop", please do read through this short section.

## Instructional Tasks

Considering the different instructional aspects that you've seen and discussed thus far, post your thoughts on the instructional aspects that you intend to include in your final project and what anti-patterns you intend to avoid.

## Project Task

**_In consultation with your instructor_**, narrow down your possible projects to your singular course project.

Once **_we_** have an agreed upon your project, make a list of tasks that you think you'll need to complete your project.  This list can be as specific or vague as you desire.  We'll revise it as we go.
