# Week 9 - APIs

## Technical Tasks

- Read through <https://javascript.info/network> sections "1. Fetch" through to and including "7. URL objects".

If you finish the above with time to spare and you enjoyed CSS Diner or Flexbox Froggy, then reward yourself with some time in the <https://cssgridgarden.com/>

- There are 2 great applications to help developers access and test APIs.

  - Postman - <https://www.postman.com/downloads/>
  - Insomnia - <https://insomnia.rest/download>

  There's also a fun pair of sites to help interpret http codes

  - https://http.cat/ 
  - <https://httpstatusdogs.com/>

  There are also more in-depth resources, such as <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status>

  There are many, many, many different APIs.

  - <https://github.com/jdorfman/awesome-json-datasets>
  - <https://any-api.com/>
  - <https://www.programmableweb.com/category/all/apis>
  - <https://github.com/aunyks/newton-api>
  - <https://mockbin.org/>.

  Download either Postman or Insomnia, select at least one public API, and then use your API software of choice to practice accessing your selected API(s) data.

## Project Task

If your project will be using external data, identify the appropriate API and ensure you can access its data via Postman or Insomnia.

From this point on, your project tasks will largely be dependent on your project's needs.  
I expect at least 2 things from you each week:
  - to see the progress that you've made
  - to have an updated task list, including the tasks you expect to complete in the next week

_In general_, you should have all of your content by the end of Week 9.  This includes any text, images, urls, etc.  And you should have all of your html content basically completed.  (You will most likely be adding to your html as you're working on the JavaScript and CSS.)

**_Remember to reach out to your classmates as needed!_**
**_And you may absolutely reach out to me more than once a week!_**

## Collaboration Task

Review your classmates' projects, let them know what you find really useful, if it appears that they're still struggling, make suggestions to help them correct or refine their code. Rubric element from Canvas: Meaningful comments, suggestions, answers to at least 2 other classmate's inquiries
