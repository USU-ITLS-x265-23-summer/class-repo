# Week 06 - Accessibility

## Technical Tasks

1. Watch  <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzRQOfVvVh4>
2. console.mihai
   1. Use Firefox
      (This only works in Firefox, after following the instructions, it will become clear why.)
   2. Press control-shift-K (for Windows) or option-command-K (for macOS).
      (This is a keyboard shortcut to open the Firefox browser console.)
   3. You've already been introduced to the browser console. I don't think it was made particularly clear that you can actually run JavaScript straight from the console, but you can.  Go ahead and enter each of the following on its own line, then press return/enter to see what I mean:
      1. `function sayHello (name = 'World') { console.log( "Hello, " + name )};`
      2. `sayHello;`
      3. `sayHello("Your name");`
   4. Now for the Easter egg, enter the following command:
      `console.mihai();` 
   5. Click on the resulting URL and read the article to get the explanation for this unusual command.
      **_WARNING: What follows is both heartbreaking and heartwarming at the same time._** Having tissues around and someone or a pet to hug is advisable.  However, this is impact and reach is something that can easily be forgotten in our day to day use of the internet â€”yet it can also be one of its greatest strengths of the internet and is something that we should all be aware of.  For me, it serves as an import reminder of why this topic is so critical to so many people, most of whom we will never know, but can be so drastically impacted by our choices.
3. Add your thoughts and impressions of the video and reading in the discussion.
