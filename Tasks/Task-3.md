# Task 3: Git & GitHub

## General Note

This is genuinely one of the hardest topics this course will cover.  You WILL have questions and be confused - this is absolutely normal!!!  Add questions to the Discussion area and we'll get them answered as quickly as possible!

## Introduction

As you might have guessed from the names, "git" and "GitHub" are related.  

If you've ever done something along the lines of keeping different versions of a file under different names (e.g. awesome_essay_may_8.doc & awesome_essay_may_9.doc) then you've been using a rudimentary "version control system" (VCS; also known as "source control management" or SCM).

Git is a just a type of VCS that most developers use.  Sadly, it is not the most intuitive software in the world (far from it).  Thankfully, for this class' purposes, you should only be using a small subset of git features, and most of those you can use through a graphical interface directly in GitHub or through an integrated tool named, "Codespaces".

GitHub is the most well known of the current git hosting services online, and has a lot of additional functionality that we'll be using in this course.


## Relationship between git, repos, & GitHub

You can think of git as a standard for organizing purposes - sort of like the Dewey decimal system.  Just like there are alternatives to the Dewey decimal system, there are alternatives to git.  Like the Dewey decimal system, git is the industry standard and most of you are unlikely to ever need to use another VCS.

Like the Dewey decimal system organizes different objects (e.g. books, films, microfiche, etc.), git organizes "repos".  Each book, film, microfiche, etc in this analogy is the equivalent of a "repo".  Most objects in brick and mortar libraries are books, likewise, most of the time a "repo" is associated with a specific project, but this not always the case.

Keeping with this analogy, GitHub is one specific library that stores many different repos (analogous books).  Copies of the same book can be in different libraries, likewise copies of the same repo can be hosted by different centralized servers.  This is similar to how both the USU and UofU libraries can have different copies of the same edition of the Websters dictionary.  Most USU students predominately use the USU library, similarly most web developers use GitHub to host their git repo.

## Assignment 3

Complete the [introduction-to-github](<https://classroom.github.com/a/xrRpKrVL>) course

## Assignment 4

In our Course-Notes repo, under the "Students" directory, create a new markdown page for yourself.  On this page, include:

- your GitHub username
- your UtahJS slack username
- a brief description of yourself and at least one additional things about yourself, such as:
  - your experience with web development
  - your experience as an instructor
  - your goals for the class
  - your favorite quote

Once you're happy with your page, make a "Pull Request" (aka PR) to have that page added to the repository.

If there are any other PRs waiting for review, review them, provide any relevant feedback, and if you think they are correct, approve the PR.

## Assignment 5

While most of your work will be done in a single repo, this repo is a collaborative effort.  As a result, you'll likely run into some challenges as you add and edit the content.  To minimize this, we'll use a process known as Pull Requests (PRs).  Work through this exercise to get an idea of how PRs work:
