### Where did HTML come from?

Hey Everyone,

I wanted to learn a little more about the **history behind HTML** so I managed to find this video.

For me personally, I learn the best when I am able to have a little backgroud knowledge on a topic, and I thought others in the class might find it useful as well.

One of the things that I found really interesting was that there was very little change in HTML between 1997 and 2014. It reminds me of the saying, "if it isn't broke, don't fix it."
I guess HTML was doing a fine enough job for a long time, so updates weren't really necessary.
