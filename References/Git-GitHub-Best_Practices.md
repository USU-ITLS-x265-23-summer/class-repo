Hello all, I think at this stage in the course it would be helpful to keep track of best practices that everyone is finding to use git and GitHub
### Best Practices with Git Hub
When you edit a page (by clicking on the pencil), it won't automatically edit the page. Someone has to review your edit before it can be merged. So don't worry about accidentally ruining a page.
Merge and then delete branches after a commit is approved.
Remember to go in and review classmates' pull requests.

Check the discussion posts frequently, and read over classmates' responses to questions. There are often questions I have with answers already posted in the discussion threads.

// We should add more things here!
