## I can't see my edits inside of GitHub?! Help!!
This is for those of you who are coding inside of visual studio in a codespace. You have made changes but they aren't appearing here inside of GitHub. Let me show you how to update GitHub
so you can view your updates!

To update your repository, you are going to use what is called a shell - lucky for you, there is one already integrated straight into Visual Studio. It is listed as "Terminal" on the bottom
section of options.

This may look a little scary at first, but I promise it isn't too bad! 

When you first look at the terminal, you should see something like `@user -> workspaces/[YOUR-PROJECT-REPO] main$ `.

This is where you are going to type your commands. Updating your repo inside of GitHub is a two-step process.

First, you need to *COMMIT* your changes:
To do this, type: `git commit -am "INSERT UPDATE MESSAGE HERE"`
The `a` argument tells git that you will be committing ALL edited files. The `m` argument gives this commit a message. You should always message your commits, so you can verify them later.

Note: If you receive a message saying that your branch is up to date, that means that you don't have anything to actually commit. No changes have been detected.

After you commit, it is now time to *PUSH* your changes:
This step is super easy! 

In the terminal, all you're going to type is `git push`. (Yes - that's really it.)

Once you do this, your changes will be uploaded to GitHub, and you will be able to view them here. 

If you need any help, post a post in the discussion and tag me (@coopsand) somewhere in the body. I can do my best to help you there.
