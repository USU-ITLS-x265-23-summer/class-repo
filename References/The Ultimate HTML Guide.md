# The Ultimate HTML Guide

I found this guide and thought it was useful. It takes you through how to set up a brand new HTML file, lots of formatting options,
as well as popular attributes that you may need to know and understand. 

Here is the link to the page: [The Ultimate HTML Guide](https://blog.hubspot.com/website/html)

Tip: If you know exactly what you are looking to find, use the table of contents at the top. That way you won't have to scroll through
the entire document.
