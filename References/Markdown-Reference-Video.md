# Markdown Video in 6 Minutes or Less

While working on the Markdown lesson, I found a quick video tutorial with some pretty nice examples. The video covers some of the basics including:

1. Heading
1. Inline formating
1. Tables
1. Images
1. Task Lists
1. Footnote References
1. A Nice video hack

Fors those who plan on using Visual Studio Code, there is a pretty nice markdown side editor example at minute 2:42 that seems like it would be extermely helpful.

## The Video can be seen here:
